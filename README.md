# GOG-only-games

Because this gets requested so often, here is a repost of a current list of games that are only available on GOG.

Although you still might get old CDs or DVDs of a lot of games, GOG maintains compatibility of these games with current OSes. This list just got cross-checked against the [List of GOG games that aren't available in Steam](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/list_of_gog_games_that_arent_available_in_steam/page6) list on GOG. Here is a list of games that you only get on GOG or where only the GOG version is playable, or where other platforms are missing add-ons and DLCs, or other features:

## GOG Exclusive Games

My list of GOG exclusive games (games that are neither on Steam nor on Origin) is originally based on the link above. (`✔` = Cross-checked against Steam, Origin, Zoom, and Uplay by me and others.) A list including all stuff, old and “new”. Feel free to let me know about any errors, etc.

## Free Games on GOG

Games that are free on GOG are marked with the symbol `­∅`.

**New**: *If free games are also available somewhere else, a `→` is put right next to the `⊘`, and optionally the other platform(s) are named as well.*

## Playability of games

I added some entries where the GOG version is actually playable in contrast to e.g. the Steam version, as noted by other redditors and/or by Steam users. If the status of a game is not sure, it’ll be marked with a `?`. Games are listed in alphanumerical order, ignoring articles and pronouns at the beginning, like “I” or “The”.

## Cleanup

I’ll strike through games that got recently taken off the list, so everyone can see more recent changes more easily. Recent additions will be marked with a `♥` and in boldface.
I’ll clean up the list every few weeks.
## Platforms this list is checked against

Other platforms used to check for exclusivity:

* [Zoom Store](https://www.zoom-platform.com/#store)
* [Gamersgate](https://www.gamersgate.com/) (only if checked by others)

* [Humble Store](https://www.humblebundle.com/store)
* [Humble Trove](https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/trove)
* [itch.io](https://itch.io/) (only if checked by others)

## **Last Changes**

**last check and cleanup: 2023-04-04 20:15:00 UTC (Universal Coordinated Time)**

### New games added at last check:

* World in Conflict: Complete Edition
* Great Battles Collector's Edition

## Final remarks

***Thank you for your contribution and help to keep this list alive and up to date!***

# GOG-only_games

Because this gets requested so often, here is a repost of a current list of games that are only available on GOG.

Although you still might get old CDs or DVDs of a lot of games, GOG maintains compatibility of these games with current OSes. This list just got cross-checked against the [List of GOG games that aren't available in Steam](https://www.gog.com/forum/general/list_of_gog_games_that_arent_available_in_steam/page6) list on GOG. Here is a list of games that you only get on GOG or where only the GOG version is playable, or where other platforms are missing add-ons and DLCs, or other features:

My list of GOG exclusive games (games that are neither on Steam nor on Origin) is originally based on the link above. (`✔` = Cross-checked against Steam, Origin, Zoom, and Uplay by me and others.) A list including all stuff, old and “new”. Feel free to let me know about any errors, etc.

**New**: Games that are free on GOG are marked with the symbol `­∅`.

I added some entries where the GOG version is actually playable in contrast to e.g. the Steam version, as noted by other redditors and/or by Steam. If the status of a game is not sure, it’ll be marked with a `?`.

Full list is in the comments. I’ll strike through games that got recently taken off the list, so everyone can see more recent changes more easily. Recent additions will be marked with a `♥` and in boldface.
I’ll clean up the list after a few weeks.
